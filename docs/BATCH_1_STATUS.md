# Batch 1 Status Update

## Current Situation
The originally planned Batch 1 files were removed during repository cleanup. The docs folder has been restored to its pre-cleanup state.

## Updated Batch 1: Current Root-Level Documentation

Current root `.md` files:
- ✅ `README.md` - Keep in root (standard for npm packages)
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Keep in root (standard location)

No additional root-level documentation files need moving at this time.

## Next Steps for Documentation Organization

### Option A: Continue with Internal Structure Organization
Focus on organizing the existing `docs/` folder structure without moving files that break cross-references.

### Option B: Selective Internal Moves
Move files within the `docs/` folder that have fewer cross-references first.

### Option C: Comprehensive Analysis First
Perform a complete cross-reference analysis before any moves.

## Recommendation
Given the extensive cross-referencing discovered, **Option C** (comprehensive analysis) is recommended before proceeding with any further reorganization.

**Would you like me to:**
1. **Analyze all cross-references** in the current docs structure first?
2. **Proceed with Option A** (organize internal structure without breaking links)?
3. **Create a new, more conservative reorganization plan**?

The current docs structure is restored and functional - we can take a more measured approach to avoid breaking the extensive cross-references.
