# StrRay Framework - Agent Overview

## Overview

StrRay Framework implements a sophisticated multi-agent AI system with 8 specialized agents, each designed for specific development and quality assurance tasks within the oh-my-opencode ecosystem.

## Agent Categories

### 🤖 Planning-Only Agents (6)

Focus on analysis, design, coordination, and strategic planning.

- **Enforcer**: Framework compliance and quality threshold enforcement
- **Architect**: Complex planning and consolidation strategies for architectural design
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates complex multi-step tasks and manages async subagent delegation
- **Code Reviewer**: Reviews code quality, best practices, and framework compliance
- **Bug Triage Specialist**: Investigates bugs, identifies root causes, and implements surgical fixes
- **Security Auditor**: Identifies security vulnerabilities and provides security recommendations

### ⚡ Implementation Agents (2)

Include direct code modification capabilities with surgical precision.

- **Refactorer**: Eliminates technical debt and improves code structure
- **Test Architect**: Designs testing strategies and frameworks

## Framework Principles

StrRay implements Universal Development Codex v1.2.20 principles:

1. Progressive prod-ready code
2. No over-engineering
3. Shared global state
4. Single source of truth
5. DRY principles
6. SOLID architecture
7. Test-driven development
8. Documentation as code
9. Performance first
10. Security by design

## Tool Integration

Available tools include bash, read, glob, grep, edit, write, webfetch, websearch, codesearch, and skill loading within the oh-my-opencode framework.

## Response Format

Agents use structured responses: Analysis, Design, Plan, Validation.
