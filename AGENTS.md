## 1. Quick Start

### 1.1 Agents Overview

StringRay provides 9 specialized agents for AI-assisted development with **automatic complexity-based routing**:

| Agent | Role | Complexity Threshold | Key Tools | Conflict Strategy |
|-------|------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| enforcer | Codex compliance & error prevention | All operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash | Block on violations |
| architect | System design & technical decisions | High complexity | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, background_task | Expert priority |
| orchestrator | Multi-agent workflow coordination | Enterprise | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, background_task, call_omo_agent | Consensus |
| bug-triage-specialist | Error investigation & fixes | Debug operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, ast_grep_* | Majority vote |
| code-reviewer | Quality assessment & standards | All code changes | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, lsp_diagnostics | Expert priority |
| security-auditor | Vulnerability detection | Security operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, grep_app_searchGitHub | Block critical |
| refactorer | Technical debt elimination | Refactor operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, ast_grep_*, lsp_rename | Majority vote |
| test-architect | Testing strategy & coverage | Test operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash | Expert priority |
| librarian | Codebase exploration & documentation | Analysis operations | project-analysis_* | N/A (solo agent) |

All agents operate in subagent mode with full tool access and automatic delegation.

**Orchestrator Activation**: Automatically triggered for complexity scores > 95, or explicitly via @orchestrator commands. Coordinates multi-agent workflows with consensus resolution.

```

### 1.3 Basic Usage

1. **Installation**: `npm install strray-ai`
2. **Setup**: `node node_modules/strray-ai/scripts/postinstall.cjs`
3. **Invoke Agents**: Use @agent-name commands in oh-my-opencode
4. **Complexity Analysis**: Tasks are automatically routed based on complexity metrics

**Agent Routing Behavior**:
- **Simple tasks** (@enforcer simple check): Direct to single agent
- **Complex tasks** (@enforcer complex analysis): May escalate to multi-agent consensus
- **Orchestrator tasks** (@orchestrator coordinate): Always involves multi-agent coordination

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Core Architecture

StringRay integrates as an oh-my-opencode plugin with optimized agent orchestration:

- **Primary**: oh-my-opencode's Prometheus planner + Sisyphus executor
- **Secondary**: StringRay's multi-agent delegation for complex tasks
- **Configuration**: Merged hierarchy (global → project → framework settings)
- **Boot Sequence**: Plugin loading → context initialization → agent activation

Framework components:
- Agent system with 9 specialized roles
- Complexity analysis engine for intelligent task routing
- Codex compliance validation (99.6% error prevention)
- MCP server integration (28 servers)
- State management and core monitoring

### 2.2 Agent Capabilities Matrix

| Agent | Role | Complexity Threshold | Key Tools | Conflict Strategy |
|-------|------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| enforcer | Codex compliance & error prevention | All operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash | Block on violations |
| architect | System design & technical decisions | High complexity | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, background_task | Expert priority |
| orchestrator | Multi-agent workflow coordination | Enterprise | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, background_task, call_omo_agent | Consensus |
| bug-triage-specialist | Error investigation & fixes | Debug operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, ast_grep_* | Majority vote |
| code-reviewer | Quality assessment & standards | All code changes | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, lsp_diagnostics | Expert priority |
| security-auditor | Vulnerability detection | Security operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, grep_app_searchGitHub | Block critical |
| refactorer | Technical debt elimination | Refactor operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash, ast_grep_*, lsp_rename | Majority vote |
| test-architect | Testing strategy & coverage | Test operations | read, grep, lsp_*, bash | Expert priority |
| librarian | Codebase exploration & documentation | Analysis operations | project-analysis_* | N/A (solo agent) |

### 2.3 Complexity Analysis

Tasks are evaluated using 6 metrics:

| Metric | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| File Count | 0-20 | Number of affected files |
| Change Volume | 0-25 | Lines changed |
| Operation Type | Multiplier | create/modify/refactor/analyze/debug/test |
| Dependencies | 0-15 | Component relationships |
| Risk Level | Multiplier | low/medium/high/critical |
| Duration | 0-15 | Estimated minutes |

**Decision Thresholds**:
- ≤25: Single-agent execution (direct routing)
- 26-95: Single-agent execution (may use background tasks)
- 96+: Enterprise-level coordination (orchestrator-led multi-agent workflow)

**Note**: Thresholds determine routing strategy, not agent capability. Complex tasks trigger orchestrator coordination for consensus resolution.

**Critical Architecture Correction**: Complexity analysis was previously not being calculated on every prompt. This has been fixed - every user request now goes through mandatory complexity evaluation for intelligent agent routing.

### Agent Skill Integration

**✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED**: All agents now have skill invocation tools and can call MCP skill servers:

- **invoke-skill**: Generic skill invocation for any MCP skill server
- **skill-code-review**: Direct code review skill access
- **skill-security-audit**: Direct security audit skill access
- **skill-performance-optimization**: Direct performance analysis skill access
- **skill-testing-strategy**: Direct testing strategy skill access
- **skill-project-analysis**: Direct project analysis skill access

**Skill Invocation Architecture**:
- **MCP Server**: `skill-invocation.server.js` provides all skill tools
- **Client Integration**: `mcpClientManager.callServerTool()` enables agent skill calling
- **Tool Discovery**: All skills automatically discovered and available to agents
- **Tested & Verified**: Skill invocation working (tested with code-review and security-audit)

**Agent Capabilities Matrix** (Updated with Skill Tools):

| Agent                     | Role                | Complexity Threshold | Key Tools | Skill Tools | Conflict Strategy |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **enforcer**              | Codex compliance    | All operations      | read, grep, lsp_* | ✅ All skills | Block on violations |
| **architect**             | System design       | High complexity     | read, grep, lsp_* | ✅ All skills | Expert priority |
| **orchestrator**          | Task coordination   | Enterprise          | session_*, call_omo_agent | ✅ All skills | Consensus |
| **bug-triage-specialist** | Error investigation | Debug operations    | ast_grep_*, lsp_* | ✅ All skills | Majority vote |
| **code-reviewer**         | Quality assessment  | All code changes    | lsp_*, diagnostics | ✅ All skills | Expert priority |
| **security-auditor**      | Vulnerability       | Security operations | grep_app_searchGitHub | ✅ All skills | Block critical |
| **refactorer**            | Technical debt      | Refactor operations | ast_grep_*, lsp_rename | ✅ All skills | Majority vote |
| **test-architect**        | Testing strategy    | Test operations     | run_terminal_cmd | ✅ All skills | Expert priority |
| **librarian**             | Codebase exploration| Analysis operations | project-analysis_* | ✅ All skills | N/A (solo agent) |

**[Agent Capabilities Matrix](#22-agent-capabilities-matrix)** determines which agents handle each complexity level.

## Agent Coordination Architecture

### Enforcer as Central Coordinator
The **enforcer agent serves as the central decision-maker** for system complexity and orchestration strategy:

- **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates every request for routing decisions
- **Rule Enforcement**: Applies codex compliance rules during operations
- **Orchestration Decisions**: Determines when to handle tasks itself vs. escalate to orchestrator
- **Quality Gate**: Blocks operations that violate architectural standards

### Rule Delegation System
When codex rules are violated, the system automatically delegates to appropriate agents:

| Rule Violation | Delegated Agent | Action |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `tests-required` | test-architect | Generate comprehensive tests |
| `documentation-required` | librarian | Create/update documentation |
| `understand-before-write` | librarian | Analyze codebase before new code |
| `security-audit` | security-auditor | Perform security validation |
| `performance-optimization` | refactorer | Optimize code performance |

### Complexity-Aware Processing
Every prompt now goes through this enhanced pipeline:

```
User Input → Complexity Analysis → Rule Validation → Agent Routing → Execution
                    ↓                     ↓                    ↓
            Enforcer evaluates    Rules enforced       Optimal agent
            orchestration needs   automatically       selected based
                                 via delegation      on complexity score
```

Full codex details: [.strray/codex.json](.strray/codex.json)

### 3.2 Complexity Scoring

**Algorithm**:
```typescript
score = (fileCount * 2) + (changeVolume / 10) + (dependencies * 3) + (duration / 10)
score *= operationMultiplier * riskMultiplier
score = Math.min(Math.max(score, 0), 100)
```

**Operation Multipliers**: create: 1.0, modify: 1.2, refactor: 1.8, analyze: 1.5, debug: 2.0, test: 1.3

**Risk Multipliers**: low: 0.8, medium: 1.0, high: 1.3, critical: 1.6

**Enterprise Complexity Example**: Pipeline consolidation effort scored **100/100** (maximum complexity):
- Files: 148+ (20 points)
- Changes: 10,000+ lines (25 points)
- Operation: refactor (1.8x)
- Dependencies: 15+ (15 points)
- Risk: high (1.3x)
- Duration: 3-4 weeks (15 points)
- **Result**: Enterprise-level orchestration required

### 3.3 Agent Delegation

**Automatic Routing**:
- Complexity score determines agent count and strategy
- Conflict resolution: majority vote, expert priority, consensus
- Session state sharing across handoffs
- Background task support for parallel execution

### 3.4 Request Processing Flow

**Complete Flow from User Prompt to Agent Response**:

#### **Phase 1: Initial Routing**
```
User Input (@enforcer, @architect, etc.)
     ↓
Direct routing to specified agent (NO orchestrator involvement for simple tasks)
     ↓
Agent receives request with full context
```

#### **Phase 2: Complexity Analysis**
```typescript
// Every request analyzed for complexity
const complexity = await analyzeComplexity({
  operation: request.operation,
  fileCount: request.files?.length,
  changeVolume: request.changeVolume,
  dependencies: request.dependencies,
  riskLevel: request.riskLevel
});
```

**Automatic Escalation Thresholds**:
- **≤25**: Single-agent processing (direct response)
- **26-95**: Single-agent processing (may use background tasks)
- **96+**: **Escalates to orchestrator-led multi-agent workflow**

#### **Phase 3: Single-Agent Processing** (Most Common)
```
Agent Tools Execution
├── read: File analysis
├── grep: Pattern matching
├── lsp_*: Language server operations
├── background_task: Async operations
└── Specialized agent tools (security-scan, etc.)
     ↓
Response Generation
```

#### **Phase 4: Multi-Agent Escalation** (Complex Tasks)
```
Complexity > 95 → Orchestrator Activation
     ↓
Intelligent Agent Router selects optimal team
     ↓
Parallel Execution with call_omo_agent/task()
     ↓
Result Consolidation with Consensus Resolution
     ↓
Final Response to User
```

### 3.5 Consensus and Multi-Agent Coordination

**When Consensus Activates**:
1. **Automatic**: Complexity score > 95 (enterprise tasks)
2. **Conflicts**: Multiple agents give different recommendations
3. **Validation**: Different analysis phases produce conflicting results
4. **Deliberate**: Orchestrator explicitly coordinates multi-agent tasks

**Consensus Resolution Strategies**:
```typescript
// From orchestrator conflict resolution
switch (strategy) {
  case "majority_vote":    // Statistical - most frequent response wins
  case "expert_priority":  // Authority - highest expertise score wins
  case "consensus":        // Unanimity - all responses must be identical
}
```

**Multi-Agent Workflow Example**:
```typescript
// Complex task automatically escalates
User: "@enforcer analyze complex codebase changes"
    ↓
Complexity Score: 120 (Enterprise level)
    ↓
Orchestrator coordinates: [enforcer, architect, security-auditor]
    ↓
Parallel analysis → Results → Majority vote consensus → Final report
```

**Agent Collaboration Patterns**:
- **Direct Delegation**: Orchestrator uses `call_omo_agent` for specific subtasks
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Consensus Filtering**: Results filtered by confidence and agreement levels
- **Fallback Handling**: Single agent response if consensus fails

**Framework Introspection**: Agents can analyze their own operations and improve collaboration patterns through the librarian agent and complexity analysis system.

### 3.4 Agent Operational Procedures

**Initialization Sequence**:
1. Load codex context from `.strray/codex.json`
2. Initialize tool permissions based on agent capabilities
3. Establish MCP server connections for assigned tools
4. Validate session state and configuration
5. Register for oh-my-opencode hook events

**Multi-Tasking Approaches**:
- **Background Execution**: Use `background_task` for parallel operations
- **Subagent Parallel Execution**: Use `call_omo_agent` or `task()` with `subagent_type` parameter
- **Session-Based Multi-Tasking**: Related tasks within same session context

**oh-my-opencode Commands**:
- `@orchestrator coordinate <task>` - Delegate complex tasks to orchestrator
- `@enforcer analyze <code>` - Run code quality and error prevention analysis
- `@architect design <system>` - Get architectural design and technical decisions
- `@code-reviewer review <code>` - Perform comprehensive code review
- `@security-auditor scan <codebase>` - Run security vulnerability assessment
- `@refactorer optimize <code>` - Identify and implement code improvements
- `@test-architect plan <feature>` - Design comprehensive testing strategy

**Subagent Invocation Syntax**:
```typescript
// Primary method: task() provides visibility and monitoring
task(description="Analyze codebase", prompt="...", subagent_type="librarian")

// Alternative method: call_omo_agent runs in background
call_omo_agent(description="Code review", prompt="...", subagent_type="architect")
```

**Agent Communication**:
- **Primary**: Use `task()` for visibility into subagent execution and progress monitoring
- **Alternative**: Use `call_omo_agent()` for background execution (no visibility)
- Internal agents use programmatic calls, not @ commands
- @ commands are for user interaction with oh-my-opencode

### 3.6 Agent Invocation Methods Guide

#### **@ Commands (User → Framework Interface)**
```bash
@enforcer analyze this code
@architect design API
@orchestrator coordinate task
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ External user interaction with the framework
- ✅ Direct agent commands from oh-my-opencode chat
- ✅ Simple, immediate requests

#### **task() (Internal Agent Coordination with Visibility)**
```typescript
task(description="Analyze codebase", prompt="...", subagent_type="librarian")
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ Agent-to-agent coordination needing monitoring/visibility
- ✅ Complex analysis tasks where you want to track progress
- ✅ Educational/learning scenarios (observe delegation flow)
- ✅ Debugging coordination (see subagent execution)
- ✅ Quality assurance (verify subagent performance)

**Benefits**: "Click through option" to view subagent progress, full monitoring, educational value

#### **call_omo_agent() (Internal Agent Coordination - Background)**
```typescript
call_omo_agent(description="Code review", prompt="...", subagent_type="architect")
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ Agent-to-agent coordination for background processing
- ✅ High-throughput scenarios where monitoring isn't needed
- ✅ Parallel processing without UI overhead
- ✅ Production automation (quiet execution)
- ✅ Resource optimization (no monitoring overhead)

**Benefits**: Fast, lightweight coordination, clean results, scalable automation

#### **Practical Usage Guidelines**
- **Simple tasks**: Either `task()` or `call_omo_agent()` works
- **Complex analysis**: Use `task()` for monitoring capabilities
- **Bulk processing**: Use `call_omo_agent()` for efficiency
- **Learning scenarios**: Use `task()` to observe delegation behavior
- **Production automation**: Use `call_omo_agent()` for reliability

**Session Awareness Guidelines**:
- Maintain cross-session consistency when possible
- Preserve user context across related operations
- Clean up session state after completion
- Handle session recovery from failures

**Emergency Procedures**:
- Escalate to orchestrator for complex conflicts
- Use majority vote for agent disagreements
- Implement progressive escalation for codex violations
- Provide clear error messages with recovery steps

**[Testing Framework](#53-testing-framework)** includes AI agent testing procedures and validation steps.

### 3.5 Framework Integration Details

**oh-my-opencode Integration**:
- Hook system: `agent.start`, `tool.execute.before/after`, `experimental.chat.system.transform`
- MCP server connections (9 servers: architect-tools, enforcer-tools, framework-help, etc.)
- Plugin lifecycle: registered → validated → activated → running → deactivated
- Configuration merging: framework → project → global settings

**Communication Protocols**:
- MCP protocol for structured inter-agent communication
- Session state sharing via shared context objects
- Event-driven notifications for task completion/failures
- Conflict resolution through orchestrated consensus mechanisms

**Tool Access Patterns**:
- Permission-based execution (agent-specific capabilities)
- MCP server routing for specialized operations (AST parsing, LSP, etc.)
- Error handling with automatic retry mechanisms
- Resource pooling for performance optimization

**State Management**:
- Session lifecycle: creation → monitoring → cleanup → recovery
- State persistence with automatic recovery from failures
- Synchronization across distributed instances
- Memory pool management for resource efficiency

### 3.6 Escalation and Recovery

**Progressive Escalation**:
- Level 1: Agent-level resolution (retry, alternative approach)
- Level 2: Multi-agent consensus (majority vote, expert priority)
- Level 3: Orchestrator intervention (conflict mediation)
- Level 4: Framework-level blocking (codex violations)

**Failure Recovery**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Alternative tool selection when primary tools fail
- Session state preservation during recovery
- User notification with actionable recovery steps

#### Rules Engine Pipeline Flow

```
Code Commit → Git Hook → PostProcessor → Working Processors ✅
    ↓
Build Process → Type Check → Rules Engine → Pass/Fail
    ↓
Test Execution → Coverage Check → Rules Engine → Pass/Fail
    ↓
Security Audit → Vulnerability Scan → Rules Engine → Pass/Fail
    ↓
Postprocessor → Compliance Check → Codex Processor (Stub) ❌
    ↓
Deployment → Environment Check → Rules Engine → Pass/Fail
```

#### Critical Pipeline Break Points

**Rules Engine Integration Status:**

| Component | Rules Engine Connection | Status | Impact |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|---------|
| **Pre-Commit Hooks** | ✅ Connected | Active | Triggers postprocessor validation |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | ✅ Connected | Active | Blocks invalid builds |
| **Pre-Validate Processor** | ✅ Connected | Active | Syntax validation (comments/code) |
| **State Validation Processor** | ✅ Connected | Active | Session state integrity |
| **Codex Compliance Processor** | ✅ FIXED | Active | Real RuleEnforcer validation |
| **Test Execution Processor** | ⚠️ Partial | Placeholder | Logs execution intent |
| **Agent Execution** | ✅ Connected | Active | Real-time validation |
| **MCP Servers** | ⚠️ Partial | Limited | Some validation |
| **State Management** | ✅ Connected | Active | Integrity checks |

**✅ FIXED**: Postprocessor now calls `validateCodexCompliance()` which runs RuleEnforcer.validateOperation() for real codex rule enforcement and automated agent delegation.

2. **Git Hook Triggers**: On `pre-commit`, `post-commit`, `pre-push`, `post-merge`
3. **CLI Commands**: Manual execution via `framework-reporting-system` command
4. **MCP Server Calls**: Through `framework-help` server tool requests
5. **Complexity Threshold**: Only generates reports when complexity score > threshold

**Complete Reporting Pipeline Flow**:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Trigger       │ -> │ Complexity       │ -> │ Report          │

└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Pipeline Components**:

1. **Trigger Detection**:
   - Post-processor calls `generateFrameworkReport()` on completion
   - Git hooks execute `framework-reporting-system` commands
   - CLI/MCP server requests invoke reporting directly

2. **Complexity Analysis**:
   ```typescript
   // Calculate if report should be generated
   const complexityScore = this.calculateComplexityScore(monitoringResults, context);
   if (complexityScore < this.config.reporting.reportThreshold) {
     console.log(`Complexity score ${complexityScore} below threshold - skipping report`);
     return null;
   }
   ```

3. **Activity Log Parsing** (FIXED - Was Broken):
   - **Before**: `framework-reporting-system.ts` couldn't read `logs/framework/activity.log`
   - **Issue**: Log file parsing failed with file access errors
   - **Fix**: Corrected file path resolution and added error handling
   - **Result**: Now successfully parses 759+ events from activity logs

4. **Shell Script Execution**:
   - Executes `scripts/generate-activity-report.js` for log analysis
   - Handles file system operations for report generation
   - Manages report output to configured directories

5. **Report Generation**:
   ```typescript
   // Generate comprehensive report
   const reportConfig = {
     type: "full-analysis",
     sessionId,
     outputFormat: "markdown",
     outputPath: path.join(reportingDir, `framework-report-${commitSha}-${date}.md`)
   };
   await frameworkReportingSystem.generateReport(reportConfig);
   ```

   **Output Locations**:
   - Framework Reports: `logs/reports/framework-report-{commitSha}-{date}.md`
   - Performance Reports: `performance-reports/` (multiple analysis files)
   - Security Reports: `security-reports/security-audit-{timestamp}.json`
   - Test Reports: `test-reports/` (coverage and regression files)
   - MCP Reports: `logs/mcp-reports/` (server health files)

**Data Sources**:
- **Framework Logger**: Recent in-memory logs
- **Activity Log File**: Persistent log storage at `logs/framework/activity.log` (FIXED parsing)
- **Rotated Log Archives**: Historical data from compressed log files

**Integration Points**:
- **Postprocessor Pipeline**: Generates reports after operation completion ✅ **WORKING**
- **Git Hooks**: Automated reporting on commits and pushes ✅ **WORKING**
- **CLI Interface**: Manual report generation via `framework-reporting-system` ✅ **WORKING**
- **MCP Servers**: Report generation available through framework-help server ✅ **WORKING**

**Fixed Components**:
- **Activity Log Parsing**: Previously broken, now working (759+ events captured)
- **File Path Resolution**: Corrected log file access issues
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for log parsing failures

**Reporting System Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Captures 759+ events, analyzes agent usage, provides health metrics

## Post-Processor Enforcement → Agent/Skill Mapping

**CRITICAL GAP**: Post-processor validations detect violations but do **NOT** automatically call agents/skills to fix them. This mapping table shows which agents/skills should be called for each enforcement.

### Architectural Compliance Validations

| Post-Processor Check | Description | Should Call Agent/Skill | Status |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **checkSystemIntegrity** | Validates framework components are active | `librarian` (`skill-project-analysis`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **checkIntegrationTesting** | Ensures integration tests exist | `test-architect` (`skill-testing-strategy`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **checkPathResolution** | Validates environment-agnostic paths | `librarian` + `refactorer` (`skill-project-analysis` + `skill-refactoring-strategies`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **checkFeatureCompleteness** | Ensures features are fully integrated | `architect` (`skill-architecture-patterns`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **checkPathAnalysisGuidelines** | Enforces path resolution best practices | `refactorer` (`skill-refactoring-strategies`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |

### Rule Enforcer Validations

| Rule | Description | Should Call Agent/Skill | Status |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **tests-required** | New code requires tests | `test-architect` (`skill-testing-strategy`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **no-duplicate-code** | Prevents duplicate code creation | `refactorer` (`skill-refactoring-strategies`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **no-over-engineering** | Prevents unnecessary complexity | `architect` (`skill-architecture-patterns`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **resolve-all-errors** | All errors must be resolved | `bug-triage-specialist` (`skill-code-review`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **prevent-infinite-loops** | Prevents infinite loop patterns | `bug-triage-specialist` (`skill-code-review`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **state-management-patterns** | Enforces proper state management | `architect` (`skill-architecture-patterns`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **import-consistency** | Maintains consistent import patterns | `refactorer` (`skill-refactoring-strategies`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **documentation-required** | New features require documentation | `librarian` (`skill-project-analysis` + documentation-generation) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **clean-debug-logs** | Removes debug logging from production | `refactorer` (`skill-refactoring-strategies`) | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |

### Implementation Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** (Block commits, critical violations):
- `resolve-all-errors` → `bug-triage-specialist`
- `prevent-infinite-loops` → `bug-triage-specialist`
- `checkSystemIntegrity` → `librarian`

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Quality improvements):
- `tests-required` → `test-architect`
- `documentation-required` → `librarian`
- `no-duplicate-code` → `refactorer`

**LOW PRIORITY** (Code consistency):
- `import-consistency` → `refactorer`
- `state-management-patterns` → `architect`
- `checkPathAnalysisGuidelines` → `refactorer`

**Note**: Post-processor enforcement now **validates violations AND automatically attempts to fix them** by calling the appropriate agents/skills. If auto-fix fails, commits are blocked for manual intervention.

**Documentation Update Status**:
The framework currently validates that documentation is required but does not automatically generate or update documentation.

**Current Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Documentation Validation**: Rules check if documentation is required for new features
- ✅ **API Documentation Generation**: MCP server available for API docs via `documentation-generation` skill (SERVER EXISTS)
- ❌ **Automatic Documentation Updates**: Not implemented - requires manual updates
- ❌ **Post-Commit Documentation**: Validation only, no automatic updates

**Planned but Not Implemented**:
- Post-commit documentation updates
- Feature addition detection and doc generation
- README synchronization
- Automatic API documentation updates

**Current Documentation Workflow**:
1. **Validation**: Rules check if documentation is required (via `documentation-required` rule)
2. **Manual Updates**: Documentation must be updated manually
3. **API Docs**: Use `documentation-generation` MCP server for API documentation
4. **No Reboot Required**: Documentation validation works immediately

**Note**: Automatic documentation updates are planned but not yet implemented. The framework validates documentation requirements but does not generate updates automatically.

---

## Rule Enforcement System

### Post-Processor Integration
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Post-processor now calls rules engine
**Previous Issue**: Post-processor only did architectural validation, never called codex compliance
**Resolution**: Added `validateCodexCompliance()` method that runs RuleEnforcer.validateOperation()

### Automated Rule Violation Fixes
When codex rules are violated, the system automatically attempts fixes:

- **tests-required** → Delegates to `test-architect` for automated test generation
- **documentation-required** → Delegates to `librarian` for automated documentation
- **understand-before-write** → Delegates to `librarian` for codebase analysis
- **security-audit** → Delegates to `security-auditor` for automated scanning

### Agent Responsibility Matrix

| Agent | Primary Role | Rule Enforcement | Complexity Decisions |
|-------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Enforcer** | Central Coordinator | ✅ Primary | ✅ Complexity Analysis |
| **Architect** | Rule Definition | ✅ Architectural Rules | ❌ Not Involved |
| **Agent Delegator** | Execution Logic | ❌ Not Involved | ⚠️ Consults Enforcer |
| **Orchestrator** | Complex Coordination | ❌ Not Involved | ✅ Enterprise Tasks |

### 5.3 Testing Framework

**Testing Approach**:
- **Mock-Based**: Plugin architecture requires mocks for ES6 import isolation
- **Unit Tests**: Pure functions, utilities, agent logic (25+ files)
- **Integration Tests**: oh-my-opencode simulation, component interaction (20+ files)
- **E2E Tests**: Full runtime through oh-my-opencode (real execution)
- **Performance Tests**: Regression detection, load testing

**Running Tests**:
```bash
# Complete suite
npm run test:all

# Specific types
npm run test:unit                    # Unit tests
npm run test:integration            # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e                    # End-to-end tests
npm run test:performance           # Performance tests

# Validation
npm run test:validation            # All validation scripts
npm run test:security-audit        # Security scanning
npm run test:mcp-connectivity      # MCP validation
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Behavioral test coverage: >85%
- Unit tests: Pure functions and utilities
- Integration tests: Critical paths
- E2E tests: User workflows

**Mock vs Real Testing**:
- **Mock**: ES6 import conflicts prevent direct plugin testing
- **Real**: E2E tests run through actual oh-my-opencode execution
- **Hybrid**: Integration tests simulate runtime with controlled mocks

**AI Agent Testing Procedures**:
- **Validation Scripts**: Use `node scripts/test:mcp-connectivity.js` for MCP validation
- **Postinstall Verification**: Run `node scripts/test:postinstall-config.js` after installation
- **Integration Testing**: Execute `node scripts/test:oh-my-opencode-integration.js` for framework integration
- **End-to-End Validation**: Use `./scripts/test-end-to-end-comprehensive.sh` for complete framework testing

**Test Execution Optimization**:
- Run unit tests with multiple workers (minimum 4 threads)
- Run E2E tests with parallel workers (minimum 4 workers)
- Implement chunked output processing for large test results
- Stop execution if 5+ tests fail (triage threshold)
- Use sub-agents for handling large test outputs (>30k characters)

### 5.4 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Plugin not loading | Agent commands fail | Run `node node_modules/strray-ai/scripts/postinstall.cjs` |
| Agent commands not working | @ commands unrecognized | Check oh-my-opencode configuration |
| Codex validation errors | Unexpected blocking | Review codex terms in `.strray/codex.json` |
| MCP connectivity fails | Server connection errors | Run `node scripts/test:mcp-connectivity.js` |
| Token limit errors | "maximum prompt length exceeded" | Context will be automatically pruned (TokenManager active) |
| Performance issues | Slow response times | Check complexity analysis thresholds |
| Build failures | TypeScript errors | Run `npm run typecheck` and fix errors |

**Debug Commands**:
```bash
# Validate setup
node scripts/test:postinstall-config.js
node scripts/test:oh-my-opencode-integration.js
node scripts/test:mcp-connectivity.js

# Monitor performance
npm run benchmark
npm run monitoring

# Check token management
node -e "const {TokenManager} = require('./dist/utils/token-manager.js'); console.log(new TokenManager().getConfig())"
```

**Emergency Procedures**:
1. Check codex compliance for violations
2. Run validation scripts to identify issues
3. Use complexity analysis to assess task scope
4. Escalate to appropriate agents based on capabilities
